# Conda Environment Rules
- **Environment Name**: AI-Compression
- **Primary Tool**: Use `mamba` (via Miniforge) for all package management instead of `conda` or `pip` for faster resolution.
- **Strict Isolation**: When running terminal commands, the agent MUST first activate the environment: `mamba activate AI-Compression`.
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Always check `environment.yml` before suggesting a new library.
  - For AI/ML packages (PyTorch, CUDA), use the `pytorch` and `nvidia` channels.
